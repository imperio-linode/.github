# Imperio Linode  

Organisation containing 4 repositories that I am working on as my main portfolio project.

Aim of this is to create friendly ui that will deploy and create linode engine, engines and k8s clusters.

💡 Kubernetes Scripts - Repository responsible for keeping track of kubernetes yamls, installation shell scripts and other important config like TLS. Basically entry point for running the app \
🚌 Gateway            - This is service responsible for receiving requests and forwarding it to other proper services. \
🏭 Instances          - Code responsible for keeping track of data and handling requests about creation, deletion and edition of instances that are deployed
🔌 Linode Services    - Node service that takes prepared requests and deploys linode instances with linode api. Part mostly unfinished yet
